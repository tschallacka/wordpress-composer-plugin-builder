Welcome to Tschallacka's Composer to Wordpress Builder.
The purpose of this tool is to help you publishing your plugins in a wordpress
comfortable format without clashing versions of plugins with other plugins
(for example someone using an older version of Carbon breaking your plugin)
This will copy all files into a new directory, moving all the files into
the root namespace you defined.

Requirements:
- PSR-4 is expected for the autoparsing of the files. Anything not PSR-4 might
  break or need some manual renaming of classes/includes.
- Make sure your current working directory is the plugin base dir when
  executing this command
- This plugin will attempt to obey .gitignore with the sole exception
  of the vendor directory.
- Classes will more from example Carbon\Carbon to YourPlugin\Carbon\Carbon
  Keep that in memory when doing magic string that can't be str_replaced
  
The build plugin will have a PSR-4 autoload command for composer included.
Make sure that you include the vendor/autoload.php file in your plugin where
needed to make sure everything is loaded as expected.

Arguments:
%s, %s Show this help
%s Do not delete the build directory after building the plugin
%s%s The root namespace under which all
   loaded dependencies should be placed.
   Ideally you will name this the same as the root namespace as your plugin
   as otherwise your plugin will also be moved into this namespace.
%s/users/foo/Desktop/bar If you wish to execute this script somewhere else 
   than the current working directory use this argument to define the 
   location of the source directory. The plugin will also be built in that
   directory
