The following php files were found to NOT contain a namespace.
The namespace has been added to those files to prevent clashes with
other plugins who might also use them(class already defined errors etc..)

This should in theory not affect their functionality, because for all they
care they are still in the same namespace.
It might cause problems if they use classes that are in the root namespace
like DateTime and splFileInfo.

Please check the below files and add a single \ for when a class from
the root namespace is instanced that can't be found.
